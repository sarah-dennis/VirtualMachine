EXISTING BUGS

  * If user presses "play" button multiple times too quickly, the program can
	return incorrect values (YAAL - PrimeFactorization)
	
  * Clicking disassemble button before assembly throws NumberFormatException
  
  * Clicking hex view button with no machine code throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
 
  * Can't receive spacebar input in YAAL input field


THINGS TO IMPROVE

  * Every ParseException thrown is an error, some could be warnings instead and
	not stop control flow
	
  * Fix how big and small labels zoom
  
  * Create os.setSP?
